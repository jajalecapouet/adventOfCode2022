cube : 6 faces

11 patrons possible.

on patron,  each diagonal squares are touched each other in the formed cube
            each touched squares are touched each other in the formed cube
            if a square has 2 distance from another without turning, they don't touch
            if a square has 4 distance from another with only turning, they don't touch

absurd case : 2 squares having 3 distance right forward is impossible in a cube


My patron is like :

        1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
        1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
